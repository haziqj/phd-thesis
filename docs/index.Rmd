# Executive summary

> Development of a novel methodology&mdash;theoretical and computational&mdash;for regression, classification and variable selection.

???

With my thesis being over 300 pages long it's only fair that I come up with a one-liner executive summary, and it is the following.
My project was to develop a novel methodology for regression, classification and variable selection.
Though mainly my work on this is computational, I also look at it from a theoretical standpoint.
My work led me to explore a wide-variety of topics such as RKHSs, EM algorithms, variational inference, Gaussian process regression, etc.

The scope of the thesis was as follows.
We began by introducing the normal regression model, and motivate the need to develop something new in this area.
Because this is something entirely new I decided to dedicate two big chapters to explaining the I-prior theory. 
This involves a review of functional analysis (mostly tetbook stuff), but also introducing the various RKHS/RKKS of interest for modelling.
The central tenet for I-priors is the concept of the Fisher information for regression function.
This is obtained in the usual way but more sophisticated differentiation tools was needed, so we looked at Fréchet and Gâteaux derivatives for this.

Chapter 4 was about looking at the estimation procedure for these I-prior models.
Chapter 5 was extending the I-prior model to categorical responses.
Chapter 6 was a fully Bayesian outlook at variable selection for linear models using I-priors.

I provided several supplementary material, which was not strictly needed for the main chapters, but nice to have, especially for somebody unfamiliar with the subject.
The aim was to make the thesis self sufficient in a manner of speaking.

For clarity Chapters 2, 3 and 4 were jointly coauthored with Wicher.
To be fair the original idea of I-priors were developed by Wicher and my research helped refined this topic further.

# The normal regression model

- For $y_i\in\mathbb R$, $x_i\in\mathcal X$, and $i = 1,\dots,n$, $\phantom{\big[}$
  $$y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon_i \tag{1.1}$$
  $$(\epsilon_1,\dots,\epsilon_n)^\top \sim \text{N}(0, \boldsymbol\Psi^{-1}) \tag{1.2} \\$$
  
???

The regression problem that we are interested in can be written as follows.
We have real response variables y and covariates X which can either be continuous, discrete or even functional. 
All together there are n number of observations, and we model the relationship as such where f is a regression function to be estimated with some normal errors.

--

- Assume $f \in \mathcal{F}$ a reproducing kernel Hilbert or Krein space (RKHS/RKKS).

???

Along with this modelling assumption we further assume that f lies in some RKHS/RKKS, which gives us nice mathematical properties.

--

- The basis for various regression problems:
    - Linear models [(canonical RKHS)]()
    - Multilevel models [(canonical + Pearson = ANOVA RKKS)]()
    - Longitudinal models [(fBm/canonical + Pearson = ANOVA RKKS)]()
    - Smoothing models [(fBm RKHS)]()
    - etc.

???

Importantly, this regression problem as stated forms the basis for various regression problem, depending on what our function f looks like and therefore which RKHS/RKKS it belongs to.
For example...

# The I-prior

- [(Corollary 3.3.1, p. 93)]() The Fisher information for $f \in \mathcal{F}$, an RKHS/RKKS with kernel $h_\eta:\mathcal X \times \mathcal X\to\mathbb R$, is
$$\mathcal I \big(f(x), f(x') \big) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n\psi_{ij}h_\eta(x,x_i) h_\eta(x',x_j)$$

???

With $f$ being estimated it is in fact a parameter of the regression model, and with that we can think about the concept of Fisher information for $f$ just like we would any parameter under estimation.
We note that $f$ may be infinite-dimensional, so we used what we think were the appropriate differentiation tools, i.e. Fréchet and Gâteaux derivatives.
This equation here would give the Fisher information for some linear functional of $f$, in this case the evaluation functional, so we can compute the Fisher information about $f$ at two input points $x$ and $x'$.

--

- Define an I-prior for $f$ to be
$$\mathbf f := \big(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)\big) \sim \text{N}_n (\mathbf f_0, \mathcal I[f])$$
where $\mathbf f_0$ is some prior mean, and $\mathcal I[f]$ is the $n\times n$ Fisher information matrix for $\mathbf f$.

???

Specifically for $x_1$ up to $x_n$ our data, we can build the $n \times n$ Fisher information matrix curly I.
We define the I-prior as being the Gaussian process prior on $f$ with mean chosen a priori and covariance matrix equal to curly I.

--

- Objective and intuitive
  - Entropy-maximising prior [(Theorem 3.6, p. 98)]().
  - More information about $f$ $\Rightarrow$ less influence on prior mean choice (usually zero), and vice versa.

???

This has a nice intuitive property, and that is the more information you have about $f$, the larger the variance and hess less influence of the prior mean and more of the data on estimation, and vice versa.
It is also the entropy-maximising prior for this regression problem as proven here.

# Merits

- A unifying methodology for regression

  - Choose appropriate RKHS/RKKS depending on problem

???

We advocate the I-prior for regression due to a number of reasons...

--

- Parsimoniuos specification
  - Often less number of parameters required to fit compared to the classical way

--

- Prevents overfitting and undersmoothing

--

- Better prediction

--

- Straightforward inference
  - Model comparison using marginal likelihood
  - Bayesian post-estimation procedures possible, e.g. credibility intervals and posterior predictive checks

# Main contributions

---

**PROBLEM 1**: Storage is $O(n^2)$ while estimation is $O(n^3)$ due to matrix inversion in posterior, specifically, assuming $\, f_0(x)=0 \, \forall x$,

$$\text{E} (f(x)|\mathbf y ) =\mathbf h_\eta^\top(x) \cdot \boldsymbol \Psi(\mathbf H_\eta\boldsymbol\Psi\mathbf H_\eta + \boldsymbol\Psi^{-1})^{-1} \cdot \mathbf y\tag{1.7}$$

$$\text{Var} (f(x)|\mathbf y ) = \mathbf h_\eta^\top(x) \cdot \boldsymbol (\mathbf H_\eta\boldsymbol\Psi\mathbf H_\eta + \boldsymbol\Psi^{-1})^{-1} \cdot \mathbf h_\eta(x)\tag{1.8}$$

???

The first of my contributions relate to estimation of these I-prior models (i.e. posterior regression function and model hyperparameters).
I explored a direct optimisation of the likelihood, EM algorithm and MCMC.
The main issue we have, as per Gaussian process regression is, storage and time requirements.

--

<h3>Chapter 4: An efficient estimation procedure</h3>

- Nyström approximation of kernel matrix to reduce storage and time requirements to $O(nm)$ and $O(nm^2)$, $m\ll n$.

- Multiple $O(n^3)$ calls in the EM algorithm, so pre-calculate and store for later use (front-loading).

- Exploit normality and exponential families and use ECM algorithm to avoid maximisation in M-step.

- Implemented in R package `iprior`.

- Practical applications: Multilevel modelling (IGF-I data), longitudinal modelling (cow growth data), and smoothing models (Tecator data).

---

**PROBLEM 2**: Violations of modelling assumptions when responses are categorical, i.e. $y_i \in \{1,\dots,m \}$.

--

<h3>Chapter 5: Probit link on (latent) regression functions</h3>

- [(Section 5.1, pp. 149–151)]() "Squash" the regression functions through a sigmoid function, via
\begin{equation}
\text{P}(y_i = j) = g^{-1}\big( f_1(x_i),\dots,f_m(x_i) \big)
\end{equation}
where $g^{-1}$ is an integral involving a truncation of an $m$-variate normal density.

  - When $m=2$ (binary data), the model simplifies to
  
  $$y_i \sim \text{Bern}(\Phi(f(x_i)))$$

- Model is estimated using a variational EM algorithm, because the E-step cannot be found in closed-form.

- Practical applications: Binary and multiclass classification, meta-analysis (smoking cessation data), and spatio-temporal modelling (BTB data).

---

**PROBLEM 3**: Model selection via pairwise marginal likelihood comparisons is intractable for large $p$.

--

<h3>Chapter 6: Gibbs-based variable selection for linear models</h3>

- Focusing on iid normal linear models only, i.e.
$$y_i \sim\text{N}\Big( \alpha + \sum_{k=1}^p x_{ik}\gamma_k\beta_k, \psi^{-1} \Big) \\
\gamma_k \sim \text{Bern}(\pi_k), k=1,\dots,p$$
with the I-prior $\boldsymbol\beta\sim\text{N}_p(\mathbf 0, \kappa\psi^{-1}\mathbf X^\top\mathbf X)$. 

- Estimates of posterior model probabilities, inclusion probabilities, and regression coefficients obtained simultaneously using Gibbs sampling.

- Simulation study and real-data analysis show favourable results for I-prior (vs. sparse prior, $g$-prior, and Lasso).

- Practical applications: aerobic data, mortality and air pollution data, and ozone data.
