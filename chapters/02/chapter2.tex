\hChapterStandalone[2]{Vector space of functions}

One of the main assumptions for regression modelling with I-priors is that the regression functions lie in some vector space of functions.
At first glance, this may seem strange, that the notion of functions (as mappings from input to output space) and vector spaces are somehow equatable.
Upon further thought, one realises that firstly, two functions of a similar, particular form may be added together (in some meaningful way) resulting in a function in that same form. 
Secondly, multiplication of a function by a scalar $c$ can be thought of as $c$ times the output of that function.
Indeed, running through the checklist\footnotemark~of what constitutes a vector space, we find that a ``space of functions'' satisfies them all.
\footnotetext{In modern linear algebra texts, this is the eight axioms of vector spaces over a field $\bbF$: The vectors forms an abelian group under addition, and this group has an $\bbF$-module structure.}

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a concise review of functional analysis leading up to the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert and Krein spaces (RKHS/RKKS).
The interest with these RKHS and RKKS is that these spaces have well-established mathematical structure and offer desirable topologies.
In particular, it allows the possibility of deriving the Fisher information for regression functions---this will be covered in Chapter 3.
As we shall see, RKHS are also extremely convenient in that they may be specified completely via their reproducing kernels.
Several of these function spaces are of interest to us, for example, spaces of linear functions, smoothing functions, and functions whose inputs are nominal values and even functions themselves.
RKHS are widely studied in the literature, but perhaps RKKS are less so.
To provide an early insight, RKKS are simply an extension of RKHS when its kernel is not positive-definite.
The flexibility provided by RKKS will prove both useful and necessary, especially when considering scaled function spaces, as I-prior modelling does.

It is emphasised that a deep knowledge of functional analysis, including RKHS and RKKS theory, is not at all necessary for I-prior modelling, so perhaps the advanced reader may wish to skip Sections 2.1--2.3. 
Section 2.4 describes the fundamental RKHS of interest for I-prior regression, which we refer to as the ``building block'' RKHS/RKKS.
The reason for this is that it is possible to construct new RKKS from existing ones, and this is described in Section 2.5.

A remark on notation: Elements of the vector space $\cF$ of real functions over a set $\cX$ are denoted $f(\cdot)$, or simply $f$.
This distinguishes them from the actual evaluation of the function at an input point $x \in \cX$, denoted $f(x) \in \bbR$.
For a much cleaner read, we dispense with boldface notation for vectors and matrices when talking about them, without ambiguity, in the abstract sense.

\section{Summary}

Brief notes on functional analysis allows us to describe RKHS and RKKS.
These are of interest because of the convenient topologies.
All linear functionals are continuous in these spaces.
Moreover, RKHS and RKKS can be specified through kernel functions.
Although it is unique for RKHS, not so for RKKS, but need not matter greatly, because the important properties that we care about carry over anyway.
Of importance is the ANOVA functional decomposition, for which we can mimic through similar manipulation of scaled positive definite kernels.
Restricting to positive scalars is unsatisfactory, so RKKS is required.
