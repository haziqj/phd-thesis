\hltodo{Computational considerations? I think go through the entire chapter without discussing computational issues, and discuss them here. Less cluttered this way.}

This is where talk about computational complexity.
Of course, $O(n^3)$ (at least) for binary, otherwise $O(mn^3)$ in general, although can be $O((m-1)n^3)$.
Worst case is $O(m^3n^3)$, but manage to reduce this.
Storage is $O(n^2)$. 
Prediction is $O(mn^2)$.

Next, issue with probit link function (so to speak) and that is to compute the truncated normal probabilities.
Accuracy?
But in the variational algorithm, also require moments involving this truncated normal distribution. 
For independent probit, this is easier.
Otherwise, concerned about accuracy as well.
