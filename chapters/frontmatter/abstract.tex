I-priors are a class of objective priors on regression functions which makes use of its Fisher information in a function space framework. 
We present firstly some methodology and computational work on estimating regression functions by working in the appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions and assuming an I-prior on the function of interest. 
Secondly, work on extending the I-prior methodology to categorical responses for classification is presented, in which estimation is performed using a variational approximation to the likelihood. 
Finally, a fully Bayes approach is considered where we use I-priors for variable selection.
