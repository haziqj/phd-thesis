Changelog

General 

- New colour scheme (LSE colour palette)
- QED symbols changed to `\blacksquare`
- Added Nomenclature
- Corrected margins as per LSE requirement

Chapter 1

- Cleaned up grammar and language, added some citations
- Now explicitly mention RKKS instead of RKHS only
- Updated graphic on thesis organisation
- Rearranged points 1, 2 and 3 of the advantages of I-prior methodology

Chapter 2

- Cleaned up tensor product definition and added remark.
- Added new remarks regarding importance of RKHSs and continuity of evaluation functionals.
- Removed corollary on norm convergence implies pointwise convergence, and the associated figure.
- New pictorial on relationship between RKHS, p.d. functions and rep. kernels.
- Adjusted graphics for RKHS building blocks.
- Added remark on general centring of kernels.
- Added remark on orthogonality at the end of ANOVA RKKS section.

Chapter 3

- Cleaned up proof I-prior theorem
- Changed notation for Fisher information (calligraphic I -> regular I), and (f -> \rho) for definitions in Fréchet and Gâteaux, so as to not confuse f with the regression function (parameter)
- Replaced all instances of RKHS with RKKS (nothing changes otherwise, because the derivatives depend on Hilbertian topology and the I-prior derivation depends on reproducing property)
- Remarked that the induced Fisher information RKHS is indeed a RKHS, since the kernel is positive definite (squared kernel)
