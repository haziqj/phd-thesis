Changelog

General 

- New colour scheme (LSE colour palette).
- QED symbols changed to `\blacksquare`.
- Added Nomenclature.
- Corrected margins as per LSE requirement.
- Cleaned up bibliography.

Chapter 1

- Cleaned up grammar and language, added some citations.
- Now explicitly mention RKKS instead of RKHS only.
- Updated graphic on thesis organisation.
- Rearranged points 1, 2 and 3 of the advantages of I-prior methodology.

Chapter 2

- Cleaned up tensor product definition and added remark.
- Added new remarks regarding importance of RKHSs and continuity of evaluation functionals.
- Removed corollary on norm convergence implies pointwise convergence, and the associated figure.
- New pictorial on relationship between RKHS, p.d. functions and rep. kernels.
- Adjusted graphics for RKHS building blocks.
- Added remark on general centring of kernels.
- Added remark on orthogonality at the end of ANOVA RKKS section.

Chapter 3

- Cleaned up proof I-prior theorem.
- Changed notation for Fisher information (calligraphic I -> regular I), and (f -> \rho) for definitions in Fréchet and Gâteaux, so as to not confuse f with the regression function (parameter).
- Replaced all instances of RKHS with RKKS (nothing changes otherwise, because the derivatives depend on Hilbertian topology and the I-prior derivation depends on reproducing property).
- Remarked that the induced Fisher information RKHS is indeed a RKHS, since the kernel is positive definite (squared kernel).

Chapter 4

- Cleaned up the multiple regression section 4.1.1, including comments on scaling and standardisation.
- Added small remark on sign identifiability.

Chapter 5

- In keeping with single letter symbols, changed KL(q||p) to D_{KL}(q||p) for Kullback-Leibler divergences.
- Edited conclusion suggestion for future work point 1.

Chapter 6

- No changes.

Chapter 7

- Added logistic vs probit as open question.
