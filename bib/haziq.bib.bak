@article{Casella2006,
	Abstract = {A novel fully automatic Bayesian procedure for variable selection in normal regression models is proposed. The procedure uses the posterior probabilities of the models to drive a stochastic search. The posterior probabilities are computed using intrinsic priors, which can be considered default priors for model selection problems; that is, they are derived from the model structure and are free from tuning parameters. Thus they can be seen as objective priors for variable selection. The stochastic search is based on a Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a stationary distribution proportional to the model posterior probabilities. The procedure is illustrated on both simulated and real examples.},

@article{Fouskakis2008,
	Abstract = {Traditional variable-selection strategies in generalized linear models (GLMs) seek to optimize a measure of predictive accuracy without regard for the cost of data collection. When the purpose of such model building is the creation of predictive scales to be used in future studies with constrained budgets, the standard approach may not be optimal. We propose a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework for variable selection in binary-outcome GLMs where the budget for data collection is constrained and potential predictors may vary considerably in cost. The method is illustrated using data from a large study of quality of hospital care in the U.S. in the 1980s. Especially when the number of available predictors p is large, it is important to use an appropriate technique for optimization (e.g., in an application presented here where p = 83, the space over which we search has 283 .= 1025 elements, which is too large to explore using brute force enumeration). Specifically, we investigate simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GAs), and the tabu search (TS) method used in operations research, and we develop a context-specific version of SA, improved simulated annealing (ISA), that performs better than its generic counterpart. When p was modest in our study, we found that GAs performed relatively poorly for all but the very best user-defined input configurations, generic SA did not perform well, and TS had excellent median performance and was much less sensitive to suboptimal choice of user-defined inputs. When p was large in our study, the best versions of GA and ISA outperformed TS and generic SA. Our results are presented in the context of health policy but can apply to other quality assessment settings with dichotomous outcomes as well.},

@article{Barbieri2004,
	Abstract = {Often the goal of model selection is to choose a model for future prediction, and it is natural to measure the accuracy of a future prediction by squared error loss. Under the Bayesian approach, it is commonly perceived that the optimal predictive model is the model with highest posterior probability, but this is not necessarily the case. In this paper we show that, for selection among normal linear models, the optimal predictive model is often the median probability model, which is defined as the model consisting of those variables which have overall posterior probability greater than or equal to 1/2 of being in a model. The median probability model often differs from the highest probability model.},

@article{lunn2000winbugs,
	Abstract = {WinBUGS is a fully extensible modular framework for constructing and analysing Bayesian full probability models. Models may be specified either textually via the BUGS language or pictorially using a graphical interface called DoodleBUGS. WinBUGS processes the model specification and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. The software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface with WinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, the WinBUGS source-code.},

Template model specifications can be generated using a standard lme4-style formula interface to assist users less familiar with the BUGS syntax. Automated simulation study functions are implemented to facilitate model performance assessment, as well as drop-k type cross-validation studies, using high performance computing clusters such as those provided by parallel. A module extension for JAGS is also included within runjags, providing the Pareto family of distributions and a series of minimally-informative priors including the DuMouchel and half-Cauchy priors.

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

@article{macdonald2015gpfit,
	Abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) models are commonly used statistical metamodels for emulating expensive computer simulators. Fitting a GP model can be numerically unstable if any pair of design points in the input space are close together. Ranjan, Haynes, and Karsten (2011) proposed a computationally stable approach for fitting GP models to deterministic computer simulators. They used a genetic algorithm based approach that is robust but computationally intensive for maximizing the likelihood. This paper implements a slightly modified version ofthe model proposed by Ranjan et al.  (2011 ) in the R  package GPfit. A novel parameterization of the spatial correlation function and a clustering based multi-start gradient based optimization algorithm yield robust optimization that is typically faster than the genetic algorithm based approach. We present two examples with R  codes to illustrate the usage of the main functions in GPfit . Several test functions are used for performance comparison with the popular R  package mlegp . We also use GPfit  for a real application, i.e. for emulating the tidal kinetic energy model for the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada. GPfit  is free software and distributed under the General Public License and available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

Two basic forms of analysis recur for data of this type: removing inactive (quiet) genes from the study and determining which genes are differentially expressed. Often these analysis stages are applied disregarding the fact that the data is drawn from a time series. In this paper we propose a simple model for accounting for the underlying temporal nature of the data based on a Gaussian process.},

	Abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit  -  among others  -  linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

	Abstract = {We propose an independence criterion based on the eigenspectrum of covariance operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), consisting of an empirical estimate of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator (we term this a Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, or HSIC). This approach has several advantages, compared with previous kernel-based independence criteria. First, the empirical estimate is simpler than any other kernel dependence test, and requires no user-defined regularisation. Second, there is a clearly defined population quantity which the empirical estimate approaches in the large sample limit, with exponential convergence guaranteed between the two: this ensures that independence tests based on HSIC do not suffer from slow learning rates. Finally, we show in the context of independent component analysis (ICA) that the performance of HSIC is competitive with that of previously published kernel-based criteria, and of other recently published ICA methods.},

	Abstract = {A method for the comparison of profiles of repeated measurements is described which is based on Gabriel's ante-dependence covariance structure. The method is intended for experiments in which no specific features of the profiles are known to be of interest a priori. The establishment of the appropriate order of ante-dependence structure is discussed and a test statistic for the overall comparison of profiles under the structure is defined. It is shown how this statistic can be decomposed into statistically independent components which can be used to investigate the form of the differences among profiles. In particular the use of these components is proposed as an improvement over the practice of calculating a separate t-test for each time of measurement. All the statistics described can be constructed from standard analysis of covariance sums of squares.},

@article{Keane1992,
	Abstract = {Although formal conditions for identification in the multinomial probit (MNP) model are now clearly established, little is known about how various estimable MNP specifications perform in practice. This article shows that parameter identification in the MNP model is extremely tenuous in the absence of exclusion restrictions. This previously unnoticed fact is important because formal identification of MNP models does not require exclusion restrictions, and many potential economic applications of MNP are to situations in which exclusion restrictions are not readily available. Thus, failure to be aware of the difficulties present in such situations may lead to reporting of unreliable results.},
